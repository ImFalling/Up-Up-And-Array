# Up-Up-And-Array
## A HTML, CSS, and JS based GUI for creating 2D arrays.

### Description
This is a web-based 2D Array Generator GUI made for my XNA game development.
I created it when I grew frustrated with Tile Map Apps like Tiled Map Manager,
and wanted a simple, reusable and barebones app.
So, I created one.

### Help
How to use:

First, either download a zip of the project, or visit my [Demo](https://imfalling.github.io/Up-Up-And-Array/);

Then, place any tiles you want in the folder named "img", and name it after the pattern
```javascript
tile_ID.png
```
Afterwards, just open index.html with your favorite browser (Tested on Chrome & FF),
and get started!

Note: In Chrome, the number input arrows are hidden. These are required to be pressed to change the ID in the pallet popup.
Writing a number in the input box wont be enough, you have to write a number and then increase or decrease the number using the arrows in order to update the current tile.
